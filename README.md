# Minimum Triangle Path
Scala SBT project to calculate the Minimum/Maximum Triangle Paths in a triangle.
It has been developed following TDD. Unfortunately I have not professional expericence using functional programing,
so I have not found a way to use high order functions. 

## Running the app
```
sbt run
```
## Running the tests
```
sbt test
```
